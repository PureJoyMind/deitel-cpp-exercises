Pseudocode for ch.04 exercise 4.13

Receive kilometers and petrol used and give back km/liter
and total km/litter

First Refinement:
    initialze data
    receive data from user
    calculate the km/liter
    add each to total
    start again

Second Refinement:
    initialize kilometer(sentinel variable)
    initialize liter
    initialize totalKilo
    initialize totalLiter

    prompt the user
    notify the user for sentinel

    while the kilometer is not -1:
        receive kilometer
        recieve liter

        add both to the total values

        initialize kmPerLiter
        calculate km per liter

        initialize totalKmPerLiter
        claculate the total km per liter

        prompt the user
        notify the user for sentinel

        show output

Third Refinement:
    initialize the following variables as type int:
        kilometer(sentinel, exit entry -1)
        liter
    and the following as unsigned int:    
        totalKilo
        totalLiter
    
    get kilometer
    notify the user of sentinel

    while kilometer is not -1:
        get liter

        add kilometer to totalKilo
        add liter to totalLiter

        initialize kmPerLiter as type double
        calculate kmPerLiter

        initialize totalKmPerLiter as type double
        claculate the total km per liter

        get kilometer
        notify the user of sentinel
