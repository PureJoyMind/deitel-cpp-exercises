# C++ How To Program 10th Edition Exercise Answers

This is where I upload the exercises at the end of each chapter of "C++ How To Program" by Deitel&amp;Deitel publishers.
I have created a folder for each chapter. 
After I finishh each chapter I start doing the exercises, so there will be time jumps between each chapters.
By doing this I try to learn good commenting and writing clean code so I can make code thats easy to figure out by others.

# How To Use
I did not name the files the number of each exercise (with the exception of chapter 2).
I named them what the name of the exercise. This is mainly because some of the codes are usefull and reusable for me, so I named
them this way so that they are fairly easy to find in the future.
You will have to read the book and its exercises to e able to understand some of the answers.
