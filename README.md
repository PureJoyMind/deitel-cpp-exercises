# deitel-cpp-exercises
This is where I upload the exercises at the end of each chapter of "C++ How To Program" by Deitel&amp;Deitel publishers.
I have created a folder for each chapter. 
After I finishh each chapter I start doing the exercises, so there will be time jumps between each chapters.
This repo is for people who have problems doing the exercises. 
By doing this I try to learn good commenting and writing clean code.
Hope it is usefull to you!
