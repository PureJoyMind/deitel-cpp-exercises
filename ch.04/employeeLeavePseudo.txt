Pseudocode for ch.04 exercise 4.15

Calculating the hours of leave accrued by the employer

First Refinement:
    declare variables

    get sentinel value 

    while the sentinel is not input:
        calculate 10% of hours worked

        add to the base 2 hour leave 

        print the accrued leave

        reset leave hours for next employee

        get sentinel value

Second Refinement:
    declare hours(sentinel)
    declare leaveHours initialized to 2

    prompt user to enter hours worked (remind of sentinel value)
    get the hours

    set floating point precision

    while sentinel is not input:
        leaveHours is added by the 10%

        print leaveHours

        set the leaveHours back to 2 for next employee
        
        prompt user to enter hours worked (remind of sentinel value)
        get the hours
